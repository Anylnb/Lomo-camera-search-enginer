So fun.  Be sure to read the instructions and you'll get great results!", 'This camera is well worth the price. I\'ve been wanting to buy an instant camera for a while, but was unsure on which product to buy. I was researching various vintage Polaroid cameras, when I came upon Fujifilm instant cameras. I liked the idea of having a modern-made camera, but with a vintage feel. Getting an instant camera from Fujifilm would mean I would have a working camera that printed pictures once I took them, but still have that "old-memory" quality to them. As I looked more into the various models, I discovered the Instax Mini 8. I like the simple design and the low-maintenance aspect to it. All you really needed was 2 AA batteries, a pack of film, and (as with all tech products) proper care. [Note: I bought a CAIUL case/bag for my camera that matches its color, as can be seen in my pictures]', "At first, I was going to buy the simple white color, but I saw the limited-edition Raspberry and Grape ones. I leaned towards buying the Raspberry-colored model because I thought it was more eye-catching. I've taken a few pictures with it and they've all came out beautiful! I think the flash adds to the vintage-quality of the developed photos, because the ones I took looked rather 90s, but clearer. The small selfie-mirror in the front is very helpful because it shows you exactly what you'll be taking a picture of.", "I have already gotten some compliments on my camera. My best friend, who owns a couple of Polaroid cameras loves the quality of my Instax Mini 8 pictures. She says her Polaroid pictures are nice, but aren't as high quality. So, if you have reservations about buying these instead of the vintage Polaroid cameras, don't. This camera will guarantee you beautiful vintage pictures, and is less than the price of refurbished/working Polaroids. Plus this color is so beautiful and will only be available for a limited amount of time.", 'I ordered this for my girlfriend since she always wanted a instant film camera. She loved it!

The price seemed a bit high for a genuine Polaroid, for a gift for a teenager, who has a phone camera for most of her needs.

IMPORTANT NOTE: it has settings (which took me a long time to discover) so if your pictures are not coming out, its because you did not use the right setting for your picture.

Im an 18 year old girl and I love it so if you're thinking about giving it as a gift, its a definite yes for all people over 10 years old.", "Bought this for my daughter who is very artistic and 9 years old.

Hope the pictures are good.", 'It eureka fine but pictures are really small.', "This is so fun.  So cute. Such a nostalgic throw back to my youth.  And it's super fun to take a picture of a millennial kid, say, a 22 year old bartender - and then actually hand them a physical picture, right there on the spot and watch their mind get blown IRL.  It's kind of hilarious. Suddenly, this old lady is the fun one taking live selfies in public.  Crazy! Also, it's a good quality instant camera.  More options for lighting than I would have figured.  Super cute size pics.  AWESOME for our annual Halloween party and photo booth - leaving guests with a party favor.  Huge hit!"]

I asked for the light blue color but all the other colors are nice as well. It's a pretty good size,  I normally carry it around in my purse. You have to buy the film separately but you can order them in bulk off of Amazon. It is such a fun camera! The pictures are like small Polaroids, and there are places to write on them if you wish. Great for capturing memories. No complaints, it works well and has an adjustment for lighting. they also have books you can buy where you can put the pictures in. I would recommend this for anyone of any age.", 'Nice!', "So much fun! Now I don't need to pay for a photobooth! All I'm gonna ask for my birthday now is for the mini film with polka dots.", 'Very excellent and fun to use', "I bought this camera almost a year ago, and I have had so much fun with it! I've taken it with me on little vacations and to Disneyland. I really like the size, it fits in most of my bags. It is pretty durable, I've dropped it two or three times, and it still works the same. The color is true to the picture, and it's really easy to clean. There is a bit of a learning curve, so don't expect your first roll to all come out perfect. Film can be pricey, so buy in bulk, maybe the 50 pack? Wouldn't buy the 100 pack, because the film does expire. Don't buy the film from urban outfitters, it's a total rip-off. Everyone who sees is totally smitten with it, as am I. It's nice to have photos to actually hold on to, instead of just a quick snap on your phone that you never look at again.", 'Pros: durable, lightweight, so much fun!', "Cons: Having to really value your film, like not taking a shot of literally everything, and trying not to give them away (it's hard, people love these things!)"]

I'm an avid journaler and wanted the pictures to add to them.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.  I've gone through my first box of film and got only 2 useable pictures for my journals.  In my opinion, the photos are not very clear, and every one comes out too dark no matter the setting.  No happy, I feel I wasted the money :(", 'Very fast shipment and very satisfied...

I took some pictures outside during a sunny afternoon and the photos didn't turn out (they were really white, no image appearing). It wasn't until I changed the setting on the camera to sunny that the pictures came out, which still had less definition than I like. The photos tend to be quite white.

It is fun to play with the settings and see what type of pictures come out. The camera is awesome and for a good price but the film is quite expensive.
