Even without it, it didn't really effect the function of the camera.", "This camera is super simple to use. I love the retro look of it. It is perfect for a teenage girl that is all about selfies with her friends, but it could be perfect for many other people. I, personally, got it for work reasons to help thank people for referrals. I had previously been taking pictures with a  phone, emailing them to myself, downloading them to the computer, then to finally print them out, and cut them to size. This was a truly daunting task. Now, I can simply have the picture in a matter of minutes. The pictures are not great quality. Honestly, they have a vintage look to them. I do feel in this day and age that Fujifilm could have improved the clarity of the photos, which is the reason for the 4 stars. Otherwise this is great camera. I do think it has a slippery texture that could make it prone to dropping and the wrist strap is a must have. It doesn't come with film, unless stated, which is also kind of frustrating. I felt like they should at least add in a few for practice. Also, there is no way to store the pictures digitally. Maybe that will be a feature in future models.", 'Fun little camera.

I grew up with 35mm and polaroids and I have to readjust my way of taking pix but if you have never been raised that way, my guess is... it will irritate you. The viewfinder isn't directly through the lens, so your pix will be off set a little then what you aimed for and the pix are darker and nothing like the brightness of what your use to, so you have to practice with distance and the flash. I practically wasted a whole package of film to get reacquainted with the way old school photo taking was.

['my 11 yr old daughter loves her camera', "My daughter asked for this for Christmas but we waited and got a much better price.  She loves it.  The color is perfect.  Just as pictured.  One word of caution - it doesn't come with film :-(.", "This camera is advertised as having a mirror but I order it TWICE and it is not the same product, doesn't come with a mirror. FALSE ADVERTISING do not order from here.", 'Shipped quickly and in perfect condition. Just got it today and still trying it out but very pretty and cute camera. Took a few pictures and they look good. Definitely recommend!', 'Tips for Taking Photos with Instax Mini!', u'1. take good care of the camera i.e it shouldn\u2019t be jostled or dropped because THE LENS circle thing WILL FALL OFF. You can stick it back on but there\u2019s always a little risk involved, the first time the lens fell off I nearly got a heart attack.', u'2. never, ever take a photo in sucky lighting (ex. Our house which is lighted purely by incandescent lamps) In fact limit indoor photos unless it\u2019s an extremely special/candid moment that can\u2019t be replaced. Don\u2019t lie to yourself and think \u201cit\u2019ll turn out good anyway\u201d Nuh uh', u'3. Always pay attention to the dial and turn it. I\u2019ve had photos come out as yellowish blanks because someone forgot to turn the dial', u'4. do not play around with the dial and think you can judge what setting is best for the weather\u2026the camera really is most accurate.', u'5. Try to wear light colored clothing. Not white because the flash will react badly. Not dark/black clothing because the background of the picture (ESPECIALLY if indoors) darkens naturally and you can \u201cFade\u201d into the background.', u'6. Selfies are always best with natural light. If not, and you\u2019re taking a selfie with a friend, remember that the person holding the camera (and therefore closest to it) is more likely to get a little bit whited out (not a lot, but a little) than the other person.', u'7. The lens can hold a surprising amount of space/number of people in one photo. This means that if for example, you\u2019re taking a photo of a big group of people, you don\u2019t have to back up as much as you think. If you do their faces will have less focus. Don\u2019t be afraid to close up a little bit. (referring here to horizontal photos of course)', u'8. The camera can take very nice photos both vertically and horizontally. Vertically is better for portraits and closeups and is very flexible. Horizontal, however, can get you a beautiful \u201cslice of life\u201d feel, when you want to focus not only on the people but the background and scenery.', '9. The paper/material the photo is printed on is thick, white, and has a little space under the photo itself for you to write something. ALWAYS write with a thin pen Sharpie. Normal pens, ballpens, ink pens whatever bleed and smudge and look plain nasty.', u'So maybe now you\u2019re wondering\u2026.wow, this camera has a lot of limitations. Should I seriously get it?? And my answer\u2026.YES! Yes you should. The photos just feel so incredibly real. It\u2019s like holding that moment in your hand. It\u2019s so different from digital photos or even printing at Walgreens. You can look at a photo over and over again, and every time notice something good and different. It\u2019s hard to explain, but these photos are so old timey and vivid, every one of these is like a breath of fresh air. And another thing\u2026EVERYONE loves instant cameras\u2026.I met my cousins for the first time this winter, and I honestly feel like we really bonded over this. Every time you take a new photo, everybody hovering around like \u201chow\u2019d it turn out??\u201d and you get to watch it develop (extremely interesting.) It only takes a minute for the photo to develop, but a few more for the colors to really pop.', u'So yes\u2026.Get it. Make sure to watch a couple YouTube tips/reviews/demo vids and be sparing with the pictures, they ARE pricey!!', 'Awesome', 'i love it but i wish i bought it around this time because i got mine for 80 bucks. to be exact 82.95', 'I got the camera the next day and I absolutely love it!', 'I love the camera and I use it quite often, yet mine was off-centered. Im not sure if this is common with all of these but my friend and I both bought one from the same person and they both seemed to be off centered when the photo was taken.', 'I love the camera. The film is definitely affordable and the quality is great.']

['This camera is so adorable! The shipping was faster than anticipated, and I am so excited to use this on my upcoming trip. Perfect size camera to fit into a small bag', 'I LIKE TI SO MUCH', 'My 10 year old loves it. Takes photos and gives them away to friends. Happy girl.', 'I received the camera this past Saturday and it came in perfect condition. The film is good and the camera works great, I love it.', 'My granddaughter asked for this for her 13th birthday. I was not aware that instant cameras were making a come-back. I remember the Swinger from Polaroid and was a little hesitant but the picture quality did not disappoint. He daddy is a professional photographer and he okayed the purchase and was pleased. Great for a 13 year old.', 'Love this instax mini 8....', 'My Girlfriend loves it.', 'My 9 year old daughter absolutely loves this camera.  I got it for her birthday and let her open it before her party because I knew she would want to use it.  Her friends were crazy about it too, and all wanted to know where they could get one.  They adored the small instant "Polaroid" type photographs, and were all sent home with a couple.  I had to police the situation because they were nearly fighting over them....I took that as a sure sign they liked them.  The camera is extremely easy to operate, and fun to use.  The pastel colors are great for young ladies.', 'My only caution with this camera is that the film is rather expensive, and it\'s quite easy to just keep "clicking" with it.', 'Remember, just like the original instant cameras,you must take one "photograph" before the film is ready to use. I made this mistake twice with a new film cartridge in....try getting a dozen 9 year olds to hold their pose again!', 'Overall, this camera is so fun and functional, I had to give it five stars.  Although we have e not owned it for a long time yet, it seems sturdy and very well built. Even though it\'s plastic, it dies have some "heft" to it.', 'Just so you are prior to purchase, this camera does not print regular "polaroid" size pictures. They are "mini" versions, but they are still very cool and the kids live them.', 'Also be aware this does not take, or keep a digital version of you photograph.  It works just like and older instant camera; Once it prints the picture, it is gone from the camera forever.', 'As long as you are aware of the price of film ahead of time, and do not have a problem with that; then I recommend this camera without reservation.', 'Have been wanting this item for a while now and decided to go ahead and purchase it. it was the best investment i could have made i love this camera and the pictures are actually very clear for such a small instant camera.', u'Amazing!!! Take it everywhere! Perfect modern Polaroid \u2764\ufe0f']

["The color was chipped a bit in some areas, but other than than, it's working very well. Really all that matters.", 'I thought its included 1 pack of film? Im exciting to use it when I received my package just camera. because in the picture camera and one pack of film. Where is the film?', 'Gave this camera to my grand daughter for her 13th Birthday. She loves it!', 'Awesome', "I ordered this on Saturday night I believe, it arrived yesterday on Wednesday, on time. It arrived without the batteries, which is why I haven't four stars instead of five. It wasn't super inconvenient, I mean it's not hard to get batteries. The picture quality is good, and as expected. Usually if you take a picture in your house, the background of the picture isn't pretty dark. The flash can be a bit much. Sometimes so I usually put the setting on sunny if I'm already happy withheld gusting for the most part. I bought a 50 pack of film, if you do it that way it's a lot cheaper. I also bought a (fake) leather case and a selfie lens to go with it. The view finder for the camera is a little off so leave room for there to be a slight mistake in positioning. I am pretty happy with this purchase, it would be a cute gift for a young adult in high school who is making a lot of memories or if you are going on a trip somewhere. It's just nice to have. I recommend it.", 'Love it!', "I like this camera for my stepdaughter, however I bought it because the picture looked more pink than red. I got it yesterday and it's definitely a very deep coral and not as light pink as the picture... Should have gotten the purple. But I already wrapped it for her birthday.", "Amazing!love this camera! Only thing I don't like is that you have to keep buying film,but film is cheap! Love it! Totally recommend this", 'Best christmas gift ever!', 'Came in time and no complaints!']

['My daughter loves this camera and it takes great pictures.  So easy and fun to use.  A must for every girl to have!', 'I purchased 15 of these in assorted colors for a theme party.  Everyone also received a small photo album and two packs of film with instructions to use it tonight!  So much fun with a group of 30-40 yo women who had Polaroid cameras growing up.  Everyone enjoyed the photo keep sakes and then they took them home where their children had fun playing with the camera.', 'Only downside is the coast of film at almost $1 per picture.  In the digital age you have to remind the kids every shot counts!', "Bought this for my daughter for her birthday--she's used it nonstop since.  One caveat--the photos are about half as wide as typical Poloraids were when I was growing up--only about 2 inches wide.", 'I love it!!', 'my daughter loves this camera she is always taking pictures with it', 'Love!', 'My Grand daughter is just having TOO much fun with this. It was a Christmas gift. Now all she wants for gifts is more film. Pictures are clear and "fun" size.', "Made a great gift for my best friend, she loves it and was so happy to receive it. It's adorable, lightweight, and intuitive to use, even for people who are used to digital photography.", 'I love this camera! It is easy to use, and is also really fun.', 'My daughter loves it. Brings back some old memories']

['Love it!', 'Niece loved it!', 'Easy to use and takes good pictures for a polarized camera and gives a nice retro feel', 'Great gift for tween', 'I am not a professional photographer, just an ordinary person that loves playing with the camera. You need to learn to use the different options like outside, inside, etc and then the pics look great.', "We bought this camera for our daughter's birthday and she loves it! Also, it has proven to be a very durable camera!", 'This camera has a nice color. I like it.', 'Good', 'Boyfriend loved it!!!!', "It's awesome"]

['Light, compact instant photos that are good quality.', 'Really cute cam a little bit difficult to find the paper...', "This is hands down the most awesome vintage way of taking pictures! I haven't used a Polaroid cameras in years and I'm not disappointed. I love that the pics are small enough to fit in my wallet.", 'Llooooove it', 'I love it,takes amazing pictures', 'What a great gift for anyone! There is nothing better then a Polaroid!', "The camera appeared to be in good condition at first, but when I tried taking a picture, the flash didn't work and they came out blank.", "I got the grape color and love it! It's a dark purple and looks great with pretty much anything. Love the vintage look of the prints! Before I left a 1 star review for the raspberry color because it was tremendously ugly, instead of red it was a faded, old looking orange. This one that I have now works and looks amazing!", u"The good: The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 is a cute, easy to use compact device. It can easily fit into a handbag and isn\u2019t cumbersome to hold but I got one of the cute and convenient cases (that did not come with the device) that has a strap for around the body to protect my baby girl. The camera didn't come with a selfie mirror so I highly recommend getting one, if you're thinking of taking selfies with it (they're fairly inexpensive) just so you know where to position yourself. The operations are minimal, since the device is almost fully automatic, if and when you rotate the dial the light doesn't move that is why, it determines the best setting for the amount of light that surrounds the subject. It uses double A batteries (which came with the device) that are easy to find! Instant gratification!", "The bad: It holds only 10 film sheets at a time. The film it's expensive. Have to get batteries for the device when they run out. Sometimes the pictures aren't as clear as you want them to be. Didn't come with clear instructions, had to look for them on the Internet. The box it comes in seemed old and faded.", "Overall I love my little camera so I say get it! You won't regret it!", 'Not much quality for price!', 'Not sure why these are so popular with the 11-14 yo gang.... Especially the girls, but when did adults ever understand kids.']
