A phone may take 100 pictures to look at, but with this camera you hold in your have every picture you take.', "Just as other reviewers said. Its a bulbously looking camera, kinda playful, but everywhere you go with it people look. I love the reaction from waiters who we ask to take a picture for us - they always get really excited and loop back after a few minutes just to see how the picture turned out. Obviously it is a basic camera - you can only pick the ISO and the camera gives you a suggested number depending on light levels it detects, and you select the level by rotating the ring around the lens. Obviously you cant change aperture or shutter speet and you cant zoom - but thats beside the point, its a polaroid! The viewfinder is slightly off target but we have gotten used it it after a few shots. The flash is super bright so we put white cloth medical tape on it to diffuse the light, which works well. Also obviously in low light its not that great and the flash ALWAYS fires (cant turn it off) so watch out for whitewashing your subject and having black behind them - cover the flash a bit or have a light source behind you. In the same way, at night it cannot pick up buildings or fountains behind you if theyre more than 5-10 feet away. Daytime shooting in parks and streets is great. I havent tried the macro (zoom) mode yet bc I didnt want to waste any shots on things like food, but Id imagine that would be the only way to manually change the aperture so you could get that nice blurry background behind the subject. Maybe I'll try and report back.", 'Fun']

Because it is a new camera, the film is also much easier to find (and much cheaper) than traditional instant cameras (such as Polaroid). There are also a few different settings available, so you can theoretically use it in brighter or darker settings. It is also MUCH cheaper on Amazon than what it costs at Michael's or Walmart.", 'Cons: The settings are not FULLY manual. You have the option of indoors, outside/cloudy, outside/kind of sunny, outside/very bright, and Hi-Key. The biggest con here is that I don\'t think the settings accurately reflect how they\'re supposed to be used. For example, on a pretty overcast day, I chose the "cloudy" setting, and the photo came out way over-exposed (as though it were much darker out and needed more flash). I\'m still getting used to figuring out what constitutes as "cloudy", but I kind of like the over-exposed look, as it is more flattering on skin (blows out any imperfections), and gives you that old-school feel of a less-than-perfect camera. I\'m still giving the camera five stars, because I would rather an image be over-exposed than under-exposed, and I have enough setting choices that I think I can figure it out eventually.', 'Pro/Con: The camera, in my experience so far, seems to take the best photos indoors, which seems to be the opposite of most cameras (digital or film) out there. Just an interesting point to note.', 'I think this camera is pretty awesome, and I may be buying more as Christmas presents this year. :)', 'This was a great camera for just the fun ability to print photos on spot! Although the instax mini does not take high quality pictures and will overexpose your photos at times, it is still really fun! To keep in mind when buying this camera: It is more a toy than a "photography camera". It feels plastic and fairly cheap (probably because it is) and if you drop it you may just no longer have an instant camera. But if you just want it for the fun of having a polaroid it suffices! I have had a lot of fun taking snapshots all summer, and it\'s a great this to have along for the ride, to capture moment, right in the moment.

The camera comes in a cute little box but is too large and bulky and just oddly dimensioned to be very cute itself.  It does not fit the hand(s) well.  If you thought of buying this camera as a gift for a child, you would do better to find a better instrument (in terms of what it can do).  This camera will not of itself open vast worlds of creative exploration, as the right camera can.  I had thought it would function like the Kodak Brownies of old, bringing high-quality photography within the reach of just about anyone, but it does not.']

These pictures are very nice, a little small, but just the right size for her generation.', "You can also purchase the film with different borders and she loves that aspect of the camera.

I love how it takes pictures and its easy to use! The pictures are the size of a credit card but still great!', 'Very retro!', 'I used up about 7 shots until I got the hang of it w/ the lighting I was using indoors, because the initial photos were too dark or had unacceptable glare. But there is a separate instruction sheet regarding the use of a feature inexplicably called "Hi-Key." This is the key to good indoor shots! First you let the camera settle on its automatic lighting setting, & then you move the lens to the "Hi-Key" position (not the "indoor" position). This lightens up the indoor shots. Once I figured that out, all went well. I used it to take photos at a special event for a non-profit organization, & asked for donations. I had a large \'59 Pink Cadillac standee that people stood behind while I snapped a photo with the Fuji. Worked very well. young kids especially liked the "magic" of the photo developing before their eyes!', 'This camera is so cute and easy to use . the pictures usually turn out great the only time there hard to see is if your in a dark lighting .

It's a great size; it's very light and small enough to fit in my purse. The photos are vintage-y and surprisingly good quality. I'd been warned ahead of time that Polaroid photo quality was terrible, so I was pleasantly surprised by how my first photo turned out. Granted, they aren't the quality of a Canon EOS, but they're still very nice. They are on the smaller side, however. They're about the size of a credit card, not the slightly larger ones usually associated with Polaroid photos. The camera doesn't come with film, I realized. For immediate use, purchase the film packets and the camera at the same time. The camera is very easy to use. Just click a button, and the photo slides up at the top. Overall, it's honestly one of my favorite purchases. It's a lot of fun, and it gets a good response out of people around me. With realistic expectations, it won't disappoint.", 'Cool camera!', "This is my first time EVER writing a review on amazon, but I just wanted to let anyone know who's curious about this camera that it's a GREAT purchase!

I did some research and it seems this is a common problem with this camera and is expensive to fix.  Taking a chance, I ordered another one, planning to return the first camera.  When the second camera arrived, the brightness dial was already broken when I took it out of the box.  So at this point, I\'ve wasted about $20 worth of film and quite a bit of time for nothing.

Will be buying as gifts for people!", "I've been wanting this camera for so long. Bought it for myself as a graduation present. Definitely worth it. Every picture is beautiful and the camera itself is adorable and fashionable. It's very user friendly. Lots of different limited edition films to collect too. It would make a great gift for anybody.", 'love love love it!!! and fast delivery..', 'Great value for $', 'Awesome little camera!! Its fun and easy to use. The small circle in the view finder in my opinion is not really centered when the actual picture comes out. Therefore aim slightly above the little circle and your pictures should come out just fine :)', 'Super cute and easy to use!', 'The pictures are really mini; about the size of the palm of your hand.', 'Everyone is always really interested in it and always want to have their picture taken.', 'Colors in picture are not good enough, picture size is too small & some times it gets stuck, not satisfy at all with this purchase', 'Bought this as a gift for my niece and she loved it... great gift for a teenage girl!', 'Worked great for our wedding reception diy photo booth!', 'My sister loves it!! Better & cheaper price on here than urban outfitters!!']

["Had so much fun with this on vacation. Film quality isn't very good.  Lighting has to be just right.", 'Keep in mind it shoots out very very small photos', 'It produces pictures too small than my daughter thought!', 'This is such a fun camera and our four year loves to have pictures immediately, rather than wait for mommy to order them. I used the pictures from this and a "smashbook" for a guest book at my sister\'s baby shower recently. It was SO awesome!! The guests all took pictures with my sister and then decorated a page in the book and wrote a note for mama and baby for later on. Totally recommend this camera, it is so much fun.', 'I bought this camera and the blue case for my granddaughter for her birthday along with a variety of film. She loved it and immediately began to take pictures.  Great purchase for a 13 year old.', "The camera is fun and I love making excuses to get a chance to use this :) my only complaint is that it's very hard to get a good picture indoors unless it's well lit. Even if the subjects come out well, the background might completely be dark. Or the background is fine but the subjects are freakishly bright. Also the flash is always on, haha. But I guess that's just how these Polaroids are so it's not really the Polaroids problem. Overall, it's doing exactly what I bought it for, so I can't complain :) it's lighter than I thought too", 'Came with batteries which was great and an adorable little wrislet so you can hold it on your wrist. The pink is such a pretty pastel, I regularly get comments on this camera. What a neat vintage idea this camera is!', "I am totally in love with every photo that I take with it. It's very easy to operate and absolutely worth it.", 'Quality equipment, not cheap junk I had seen by another mfg', "Just received this little camera and I love it!! I ordered the film along with the camera so I can start using it right away. The camera is pretty easy to use and the included instructions are easy to follow. I was pleasantly surprised to find the lighting settings on the camera because I wasn't aware that this nifty little camera had that capability. So far I've used it indoors as well as outdoors and the pictures turned out so well! I love that the polaroids have such a vintage feel to them and look forward to using them to decorate my dorm room soon :) PS. I got the pink one and its just as cute as it is in the picture. I plan to put the camera on a bookshelf to add a nice pop of color to my room!"]

['Great, fun little camera!', 'Beautiful', 'Very trendy. Daughter loves it. Got to play around with distance and lighting so get extra film.', 'Very pleased', 'Easy to use & very handy to carry or in your bag. Fast startup.', "its all fun time again with this camera XD small easy, of course the film is pain to pay off, but hey if u love fun stuff, and don't expected super high quality photo..its instant camera...mean to be a fun camera :D", 'excellent. was big into polaroid but couldnt afford the film from overseas thru impossible project. this is an even better alternative', 'This camera made me excited as a 5 years old child. I recommend everyone to buy it and enjoy the memories!!', "Gave it a 4 star because I didn't know the pictures would come out so small but it's still a good camera and I use it would recommend if you dont mind the pictures being on the smaller side", 'nice product']

["My friend got one of these yesterday and I've been wanting one for a while but I wanted to make sure it actually worked good! It's awesome. The pictures come out so good! So I ordered one last night and I came home the next day and it was on my front porch. Super quick delivery and the cameras amazing!", 'great', "Great camera. You have to make sure that the camera is on the right setting before taking the picture. Pictures from far away aren't very clear and the polaroid film is quite small so it is difficult to see people more than 3 meters away. Also make sure that your fingers aren't covering the light sensors because it will mess up the exposure. Overall, it is such a fun camera to use and it is a crowd pleaser.", "Love how you can take a picture and have a concrete copy of it on the spot! The only downside to this is that the film is a bit expensive, but it's worth the fun you'll have with this camera. Super careful packaging when it arrived and on time too! Everything about this camera is amazing.", 'thank you.', 'best thing i purchased !!', "Perfect conditions and resonable priceing. Best camera i've bought.", 'its a hit!!! everyone loves taking mini photos!!!! great at parties!!', "Love it! Film isn't too pricey either!", "Its very hard to take a good picture. The instructions are not easy to follow. You wasted a lot of expensive photos to learn how to use the camera. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."]

['Love this camera', 'GOOD CAMERA!!', 'Gave this a gift to a 13 year old and she takes it everywhere now.', 'Gorgeous camera, takes lovely pictures. I just wish it was easier to clean & created less smudges.', 'arrived in a timely manner and as expected', 'Nice little camera.', 'Great camera, compact and does just what I had expected! Would also make a lovely gift for someone!', 'Absolutely adore this point-and-shoot camera :) simply click the button to open the lens, allow the camera to suggest a flash setting based on the room brightness, and take the picture. Pictures always turn out wonderful, but avoid taking snaps of bright objects or sunny areas. The flash cannot be turned off so these areas might come out washed out.', "I have one in pink but sometimes when I take a picture it doesn't come out. Like it comes out blank . What do I do ?", "LOVE this camera. It is so cute, and although it's quite expensive to keep taking instant photos with, they almost always turn out cute."]

['love it!', 'Great product and transaction.', 'LOVE IT!!!!!', 'Was fast and exactly what I ordered', 'good', "I bought this camera as a gift for my cousin's 21st birthday. She's only used it three times and it broke. No matter what AA battery she uses, there is always a red flashing light on the light adjustments and a red light at the view finder. She's even looked at the manual and changed the battery accordingly (change the battery while the camera is still on, and leave it so the flash could charge). It's been over a few days and it's still flashing. This camera is cute and simple to use, but it doesn't seem to be as stable as I had hoped it would be, since so many people has bought and raved about this device.", 'Amazing cam and always complimented on the photos!', "I love this camera it's co cute/kawaii I love how it looks on my desk and I love the small pictures it takes I colors are all cute and the picture quality it's really great. I haven't used it as much as I thought I would but still enjoy it a lot", "Great photos, I'm very surprised.", 'We love this camera.  What a fun addition to have around.  Used it on vacation for a sweet set of photos instantly!']

['Perfect! Very satisfied!', "The camera is GREAT! It is exactly what I wanted- instant pictures and easy to use. It is small enough to be convenient but still big enough to feel comfortable when taking pictures. The pictures themselves are a good size as they can be easily displayed or stored in a wallet. I actually was planning on buying this camera for awhile but was still considering my options. My Dad had given me his old Polaroid but the film was so expensive ($24 for 8 pictures!!). So I finally decided to purchase the Instax Mini 8 and I could not have been happier. Film is still a little expensive to keep buying but for the value pack of 50 pictures for $39, it is a much more reasonable purchase. Also, word of warning, make sure to buy film as the camera does not come with any. And if you don't want to customize the films' edges yourself, there are really nice decorative films available as well.", 'Really cool', 'So beatfull', 'I use this camera to take pics every few weeks in order to keep monthly journal/scrapbook for each of my kids. Makes it so convenient in a time where we have so many digital photos that we tend to store and not print out! Love this camera! A classic with a modern look!', "Really fast shipping!!! I totally adore this camera. However, it doesn't come with close up len which is for taking selfie.  It doesn't matter that much though.  The camera is really light and easy to use. I am going to bring this mini 8 to my boyfriend's house during this Christmas and create some special memories with him. Can't wait !!!! Love Fuji insta mini 8 !!", 'My family loves it!!', "I bought this as a birthday present for my wife, and she loves it! It is the perfect storm for anyone who loves pink, loves taking pictures, and loves to scrap book/commemorate occasions. The film which accompanies it is somewhat expensive, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than their teens or as a replacement for a digital camera. It's meant for novelty and nostalgia, not for volume photography.", "The camera was for my 12 year old daughter..it's super cute! But unfortunately, the quality was poor. She was only able to get about 6 pictures out of it before it started malfunctioning! We're going to try and fix it, but I have a feeling it will be returned.", 'Just like the old Polaroid except the mini version. Pictures  are the fun size, Easy to operate, but not as compact as I would have liked.']

["Absolutely the best purchase I have ever made on Amazon. This is the coolest camera, and all of my friends are jealous! The film is a little steep in price, but I buy the film on Amazon so it's not so bad. But if you're thinking of buying this product, I recommend it! It's especially great for parties and wedding registry ideas.", 'i like it', "LOVE this camera. It's so cute, and it's just awesome taking instant credit card sized photos.", 'Perfect for my daughter', 'love it just what I expected', 'My daughter loved it ... Amazing gift !!!

['This straight up old school camera was a hit with my tween daughter and her friends.  It is available in a variety of colors, but strangely, did not even come with a basic case.  It takes decent enough pictures, but it is mostly for the instant gratification factor for a generation growing accustomed to just that.', "I ordered a pink one and got a blue one...but I'm digging this blue one better hehe. Overall I think this was a great order, it looked like a used box but the camera is super new. It comes with a little hand strap and two AA batteries. Everything is easy to use, instructions were easy to follow. I took one picture and it came out super nice! Shipping was much faster than I expected. I love it!!", 'The pictures are all dark', "It's like way too cute!!
