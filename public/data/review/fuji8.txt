It's wonderful!", "I have seen these all over Pinterest so I bought one for a family party. It does not come with film you have to buy that separately and it can be a little expensive (I mean who really buys film anymore anyway?). The shipping was pretty quick. I saw the same Camera for about $20 more at Michaels so this was a pretty good deal. When you first get the camera it is a little trial and error. I am so used to using my iphone as a camera that looking through a lens confused me. It has a very small viewer so you have to be careful your finger doesn't cover it. Once you get a hang of it it is pretty fun but it will take you a couple of tries. The whole anticipation is for when the pictures come out. It is so old school and that is half the fun. The picture quality is as best that can be expected for a mini instant camera and the pictures are fairly tiny. The finish of the picture tends to be a little washed out but then again you are not using this camera for high quality photography more like a novelty. The pictures have a little tab at the bottom that that you can use a Sharpie to write messages on.", 'It was erevything perfect! Amazing product.', "I love it!

I was so happy to see that it takes a few seconds for the photo to develop just like the old ones did. I think the size of the photos are cute and NOT too small. I went with this brand mostly because I wanted the look of the original Polaroid film with the white boarder. Next on my list will be the Instax printer so I can print pictures that are on my phone.

Even EBay had expensive cameras ranging (for a new camera) from 80-100 dollars. When I found this camera, the fact that it was only $69 was shocking. I love it so much. All of my expectations that I had been building up from the videos and reviews on it were actually true! I also recommend 100% buying the film on Amazon too, because places other than Amazon are very overpriced, and can be roughly a dollar per picture! I bought a 2 pack for only $16!!! I love this camera and recommend it to anyone who was like me and obsessing over it!", 'P.S.....', 'I have friends that have the blue and yellow ones, and my favorite is the pink(:', 'Great', 'My daughter absolutely loves it.

I do think the film is a bit expensive but i bought a pack of 50 and have used about 34 of them. There is definitely some trial and error.

She has taken at least 100 pictures and has not had to replace the batteries yet and the quality of the pictures continues to be the same as the first pictures that she had taken.  The downside is that the film is slightly pricey (around $38 for 50 pictures), so keep that in mind when purchasing the camera.  But, it is worth it to me since she enjoys it so much.

Once you get a hang of it it is pretty fun but it will take you a couple of tries. The whole anticipation is for when the pictures come out. It is so old school and that is half the fun. The picture quality is as best that can be expected for a mini instant camera and the pictures are fairly tiny. The finish of the picture tends to be a little washed out but then again you are not using this camera for high quality photography more like a novelty.

['The camera only worked for 1 week and then it no longer worked. I changed the batteries and film after the first roll was used and still nothing. Good thing I purchased a warranty for this camera. Also beware because this camera does not come with a serial number or a model number.', 'I, like many others according to the reviews, received the Instamax Mini 8 in raspberry that does not have a selfie mirror. When I decided between options, I also chose it because it was a unique color and also for the selfie mirror since that was the added bonus. Disappointed the product I received did not have that option as advertised.', "That being said, it's a fun, instant camera. Throw in the batteries that were included and a pack of film and fun will ensue. Overall, fun, inexpensive instant camera. Much better deal buying through Amazon than through outlets like Urban Outfitters, in every color.", 'Fujifilm has brought back the nostalgia of having instant photos at your fingertips. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera is light-weight and affordable compared to other instant film cameras. Polaroids in general have returned to the market with the pop culture movement for instant photos, however Polaroid cameras and the film are far from affordable. The Fujifilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Film Camera provides all the fun and nostalgia of a Polaroid, but at a fraction of the cost. I have used three sleeves of film and have not experienced any problems with the camera itself. It is ergonomic and because it suggests which setting to use based on lighting, it makes photography fun for the little ones as well! While I tend to protect all photography equipment, this camera does tend to scratch due to the plastic body, but the camera function and mechanisms are unscathed. I searched several sites and did a lot of research before deciding on purchasing from this Amazon seller. The product was shipped quickly and was well protected from the negligence of deliverymen. I would purchase from this seller again, and I recommend the Fujifilm Instax 8 Mini Instant Film Camera to all photography novices and instant film enthusiasts.', 'Such a beautiful camera, loved the color, loved the photos but i must say that no all of the photos get revealed, some of them stay white idk why.', 'We loved it .. I used it  for my son birthday party, and it was a blast. We had a photo booth and mini camera was perfect for that and the picture we gave them away..', 'Absolutely the cutest camera ever! It was a present for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it. Easy to use and takes great Polaroid style pics.', 'Awesome', 'My daughter loves it', 'Was a gift and far as I know she loved it.', "Great fun and for keepsake photos. Got this and the film for my daughter's bridal shower and bachelorette party. Would recommend"]

['My camera ceased working and pulling film thorough, although in the box it claims there is a one year warranty the company claims my product is outside of claiming its damage. That is absurd, why offer a one year manufacturer warranty under that case?? So unprofessional.', 'Great gift for a 13 year old girl!  She loves it!  I believe her mom said that she squealed when she opened up her gift.  I am very happy and she is too.', "Love my instax camera. It's easy to use and love the photos it takes. Great for parties and scrapbooking.", 'I loved all of these products', 'good deal and works well', 'BE WARNED: If you use this outside you have to cover the flash, and even that only works in overcast conditions. I used in the daytime and covered the flash, set it to the daylight setting, and my photos were just white (meaning way overexposed). :(', 'Its a great camera and its really cute you can take it anywhere. Its very easy to use as well.', "I ordered the polaroid camera thinking that it would come as described and it didn't. It was missing the selfie mirror that was supposed to make it worth its price and its limited edition claim. The seller lied about the product that they were selling.

['Bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it!! Polaroid still rocks in this digital age.', "no selfie mirror as other reviews mentioned.  I wasn't as disappointed since I read previous reviews but that's still unfair to advertise as such. Overall camera takes good pictures-  still learning the settings as some pictures some out too dark or too light.", 'really nice camera!!', 'Bought as a gift for a 15 year old.  Loves it!  No end of fun taking pictures.', 'The camera is very light and sturdier than it appears to be.', 'Have experienced no problems with photo quality.', 'Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she has beyond loved it. It works without a problem and is very easy to use. Overall a great Polaroid camera and I would gladly recommend it!', 'I love this camera. Strated showing it off and now everyone of y cousins and aunts are buying it. Great to capture memories which are created everyday.', 'Daughter loved it. The pictures are clear and smaller than the old Polaroids - wallet sized. She had fun getting instant pix of friends at a party.', 'Works great!', 'This is one of the most fun cameras I have ever used (and I have used the original polaroids from way back).  The pictures are very small but you can capture a lot on such a small frame.  I get this camera out at family gatherings and give the photos away as people are leaving.  Often when I visit their houses, I see those photos on display up on their refrigerators and bulletin boards!', 'Got this for my daughter for her 14th Birthday. She loves it! easy to use and pictures come out pretty good for such a little camera. Only complain is that I find the film to be expensive. she went trough the first 50 quiet fast!']

Works great!", 'This little gadget is great for fun nights with friends thank you.', 'My daughter loves this camera! Instant prints are a plus.  The only problem is that even with the sunlight settings, everything is still a bit washed out. Cloudy days are great!', 'Although the film is extremely expensive, it was totally worth it! The pictures come out so clear and vibrant!', 'Good camera to play and take funny pictures. But dont expect great images from it.', 'I love it!!!! Takes me back in time']

Love the size of the pictures and the ability to have them right away.', "Bought it for my niece and she loves it!  Nice price not pics.  I didn't give it 5 stars because the film is pricey.

['very good', 'Perfect. Everything I expected.', 'BUY THIS', "Just be careful if you take pictures outside in the summer because your pictures could get over-developed in the heat. Otherwise it's great after you figure it out.", "The camera is a lot lighter than I expected which is great because I'll be taking it to Thailand, love how a set of batteries came with it, but I didn't know the film wouldn't come so I'll have to buy that but its a great product! Thank you!", 'AMAZING! Came in great time, and packaged very well.', "Definitely one of my guilty pleasures in life is taking pictures and I love doing so with this camera.

['Nice camera and takes great pictures', 'Got this for my teenage daughter and she loves it.', 'Such a great price! Comes in the original packaging.', 'Fun for quick moments, not much control over the images.', "Dropped it once from 3 1/2 feet in the air and it's done for, so the stability of the design is poor.", 'Getting a Neo Classic instead so I can have more control', 'Fun and easy to use. Takes great pictures', "It's fun but beware, if you buy this, you're going to spend lots on film! but it's fun and cute so...that's what makes it popular, instant picture.", "Cute & fun camera, perfect for my 8 year old's journal.", "It's so nice to have an instant memory to keep forever and this is exactly what this camera gives you. Although quite expensive, you can buy decent digital point and shoots for this price, the novelty of instantly having the snap to put in your wallet or photo album is great. The pink, which I bought, is a lovely pastel pink although I wish I had bought the white one I can't fault it. It's clearly marketed at the asian market however I think any creative person or photography lover would absolutely adore this little camera. It's a little large but still handbag sized. Yes, the film is very expensive, but film has always been expensive and probably always will be. The pictures are the perfect size for your purse or wallet, make a nice gift inside a card or photo album/scrap book and come out clear, good quality, but with a vintagy polaroid feel. I love my instax mini 8 and will use it forever.", 'Being new to the instax camera, I thought the film I had was expired. The shutter and settings do not work well, and the camera will spit out a blank piece of film. Very upset that once I realized that it was in fact the camera, I could no longer return it.', 'Cutest camera ever - and takes really good pictures - very easy to use also.']
