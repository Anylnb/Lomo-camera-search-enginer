A lot of the times, the pictures are very dark so you have to play around and adjust the settings. If you room is really bright, the picture is going to come out super dark.(don't make that mistake like I did).

The directions is in Chinese so was unsure of what setting to use. Picture from the bathroom came out very dark then switched setting to cloudy I believe and worked better. Wish it came in English of what settings to use for what. But nice camera. The flash on the photo is from my phone to show you what it looked like.", "I am absolutely in love with this camera! Plan to take it everywhere I go. I mainly got this camera to capture college memories and to have them instantly. The film can get rather expensive, but I bought a boundle pack of film of 60 for $30 off Amazon. If you are interested in starting a Polaroid collection I would start with this camera.

I wish the film was cheaper, but still think its totally worth it.', "Gave this to my 10 year old for her bday.  She LOVES it!  It takes small pictures, about half the size of the classic polaroid I remember.  But it's a cool throwback for the next generation.  Film is a bit expensive, about $1 per picture, but I think I remember it always being that way.  Anyways its pretty cool and my daughter loves it.", "everything was fine I didn't have any problems", "Ive only had this for about a month and a half and I took it to Disneyland with me and I was ready to take a whole bunch of photos but when I took one, the film wouldnt come out but the number was going down.

The battery cover comes on and off easily, loading the film is easy to do as well.  This is a nice little camera to have fun with. You can change settings whether you are indoors or outdoors, the camera actually suggests the setting to use.  The own downfall for this camera is that you have to keep in mind that the view finder is off to the right.  So while you may have your subject in the center through the finder you do have to compensate a little bit so that your subject is in the center when the film pops out at the top. Otherwise this is a great little camera to have especially for the trip down memory lane and also for those moments where you want to capture something right away and let people walk away with an instant memento.", 'LOVE IT', "It didn't come with the film that it said it would, but it did arrive on time.

Also it is hard sometime to center the picture as the viewfinder is off to the side and not closer to the center but I always go based off the lenses, but for people not used to the camera they tend to be off the first few tries if you are trying to get them to take a photo for you.

I like the outside appearance even its usage and product. It is lovely. I always wanted to have this!', "Really cool camera, but it's SO hard to take a quality photo. I have tried all of the different settings, and my pictures come out extremely overexposed or way too dark. It's almost impossible to take a good picture outdoors. Indoor pictures turn out better, but still not great. It's a shame because the camera itself is really cute and fun, but unfortunately it doesn't take good photos.", "This camera is SO very retro fun.  My elementary-aged kids have never experienced a Polaroid, so this was incredibly unique to them!  Amazing that you get a picture right there!  The quality is that of an 80's Polaroid, so don't expect perfection, but for the novelty we love it.  The film can get expensive, but a three-pack outlasted the kid's attention span for several weeks.", "It is very easy to use, light and looks nice to your eyes. Very fun to shoot with it. When I first got it I was so pleased by how everything was nicely bubbled wrapped and protected. It's compact and easy to carry around and the batteries last for ages. The quality of the camera and the pictures are amazing especially if you're into scrap booking or just into the feel of old fashioned pictures. I loved it everyone in my family loved it and I even got other people purchasing one for themselves. I suggest if you're thinking about buying one to go for it because you won't regret it. So far, I don't have any complaints at all.", 'Super cute! Whenever I use it around kids they all want one, lol. Heck, so do their parents! Easy to use, comes in different colors, and so much fun! :)', u"My c\xe2mera doesn't work! It doesn't worth the money"]

["I really like the camera per se, but the specific one that I received had signs of wear. The compartment where the film is placed does not lock completely, which does not affect the performance but it looks awful in a brand new camera. It also had little (but annoying) black stains that I couldn't take away. I am not taking away more stars, even though I should, because the camera is just awesome and I've taking photos like crazy. It reminded the materiality of traditional photography, which is something that we tend to ignore due to digital photography. Being able to look at the process of the chemical record of the light in these photographs is so interesting and fun. I am currently writing one chapter of my doctoral dissertation on analogue photography, so this camera has been the best idea for my procrastination time. Overall, I recommend the product but not the seller.", "The best purchase that I've done so far!", 'I love it! The only downside was film isnt included but i bought it separately. Its so cute and love the color i recommend this too others who want one.', "So I just got my camera yesterday and took it out to the park. I really love it. I have a Polaroid 600 camera that I was using before, but this compared to that is so much nicer. The camera itself has a fresh, clean and easy to use look to it. The instructions come in a ton of different languages, but English was easy to find and were simplified in easy how to instructions. Polaroid 600 was a thrifted camera and it was hard to get used to. The insta max camera includes a wrist strap which made the camera easy to carry around tha park. The Polaroid 600 is a neck strap which hurts after an hour. Once I took an insta max photo it came out quietly and quickly. Polaroids always came out loudly. Also with my Polaroid camera it was always a hit or miss with the quality of the photos, but my insta max mini has given me nothing but great ones. I'm very glad I made the swap from that camera to this one. It's will defiantly be on me at all times.", 'HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A YEAR NOW. LOVE IT SO MUCH! ALTHOUGH THE FILMS ARE EXPENSIVE, BUT STILL WORTH IT!', "Love it! Even when my dog moved while I took the picture it wasn't blurry.", "I haven't seen this addressed so I thought I'd bring it up. This is NOT a digital camera that you can move photos from to another device? There's no USB connection. It's completely useless without the film? At nearly $1.00 per photo this seems HIGHLY impractical. Sure the camera is only $60.00 but think about how much you would spend using it!", 'Got this for my mother for mothers day I know she is going to love it thank you :)', 'This was a gift for my daughter and she is in love with this camera thanks', 'Great camera, but all the instructions come in Japanese,  my daughter had to watch a few youtube video to make sure she was installing the film right the first time.']

['Came way earlier than expected and was undamaged. Camera works great.', '10 yr. old Daughter loved instant photos', 'Awesome and fun little camera- super fast shipping too!', 'Product quit working and it is April 2nd. Tried to return but says it is not eligible. Do not spend your money on this and risk it not working after 2 months.', 'It looked likeit was left in the sun for days! I know i had one before but it was stolen.', 'love it', 'This little camera is so cute and perfect for tweens!', 'Absolutely cool camera, bought it for simple use. Surprised how much fun me and the gf have had with it. I havent purchases the special film with designs but the standard gives a classic look.', 'Turns on kinda simple, one push button. Took a second for me to realize that the different lighting options are on the lens. The camera senses the lighting and lights up the most appropriate option.', 'Side notes: Photos are ruined if the flash reflects of a window. Runs on Double AA, insert the film and leave it closed because the "PHOTOS REMAINING" counter resets when the flap opens. You cant upload photos online, weird right? But kinda awesome if you dont want people to see them.', 'There were glitches in getting it to work properly.', 'I absolutely LOVE this camera. Super cute, easy to use. Does not come with film, you have to buy that desperately. Great buy, a little expensive but its overall a great camera & gift!!! Totally would recommend.']
["It's a different experience taking pictures that you instantly get to hold and share with physical friends. The camera is well made and designed. The quirky look and color encourage a playful mood for snapping shots. The lighting sensor is great, and having to manually switch the setting lends to the creative process of crafting that perfect print.", 'Still learning the item, the batteries do not seem to last long. still open to further review.', "It's nice to have the pictures come out instantly, but the turning piece in the front that helps with the lighting doesn't really work. If I turn it, it doesn't change to the setting it is supposed to. Also better on not so sunny days, I tried to take a picture at the zoo, and all I got was a white picture because it was too bright and I couldn't change the settings or anything.", "I've always wanted a poloriod camera, and this was the best gift to myself. I love the little pictures that comes out or it. It's also a comfortable hold in the hand. I would totally buy this for someone", 'Loved it!!!', 'Love it', 'Nice camera', 'I was VERY pleased with my camera. It takes wonderful pictures and is very easy to use.', 'My girlfriend loves this!', "It's been great so far can't really take photos from a distant but it's still good. My daughter was very happy she got it for Easter."]
