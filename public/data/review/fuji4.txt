The view finder doesn't line up with the actual lens, so trying to take a centered picture is a matter of guess work. The cost of the film isn't cheap either, so having to take multiple shots to get it right is pricy. I'd recommend checking out other cameras before getting set on this one.", "My boyfriend and I take pictures with this constantly!  Since I bought it he's decided to order one of his own.  The pictures are adorable and so personal.  I think we often forget how sentimental we are; it's nice to be reminded of that.", 'Love this camera', 'SUCH a fun camera! The price is pretty comparable to Walmart at times, but still a great buy!', 'Just received it, tried it and it is working great!', "Came packaged very well!

I purchased this for my 7 year old and she is very stoked. The film is incredibly easy to load. Just open the back, line up the yellow marks on the camera and film, and lay it in. One button to turn on the camera, one to take the picture. Simple. The picture comes out fantastic. It does not work miracles, a dark room is not lit up by flash alone. There is a countdown window on the back of the camera that shows how many pics are left. Very helpful. The instant gratification of having a picture in hand is a happy kid maker. On a side note, I ordered the raspberry color, which is slightly more orangey than it is pink. It is not exactly the same as pictured. Very very happy with the camera!', 'I love using this camera for my art journals. It adds some "old school" feel but saves me tons of time because the pictures are instant.

However, for the cost and for what it does, I was not overly impressed.  This is basically a re-do of the old classic polaroid instant camera.  I would not call it an upgrade  - it is a new style - and it has a built in flash with some picture-taking options depending on your environment, but overall it's the same thing as the classic.  Pay attention to the size of the pictures this thing produces as I recommend you only attempt to take close-ups with no more than 3 people or objects in the frame.  it is not a good option for groups or distance at all.  It is pretty much the equivalent of a hand-held photo-booth like the ones in your typical mall.  My 9-year old loves it but you have to be sure you keep track of the film because it is a bit costly.  This probably would be a great thing to pass around at a party but I would not make this your primary source of pictures.  It is closer to a toy than a legitimate camera.", "This camara is absolutely adorable! I love the color and how small it is. The pictures come out nicely too. The only thing I don't like it's that it doesn't focus very well when an object is close to the camara, also I don't use the settings provided bc they tend to make the photos come out too bright. I use one setting for all my differently lighting and it seems to work just fine! It is definely worth it.", 'I absolutely love my camera! It came in perfect condition and on time. I have honestly nothing bad to say about it. :)', 'Paid $74 and only getting back $62 :(', "My daughter wanted this camera for Christmas, and she loves it.  It is like the vintage Polaroid instants.  The pictures are smaller than the vintage Polaroids.  It is a fun party size camera.  I would recommend a close up lens that you can buy separately for selfies, etc as the lens on this camera isn't designed for close up shots.", "This camera is so much fun!

I like it but I wouldn't say I love it.  The picture quality isn't there which is what i expected but the camera sometimes pauses for too long before it takes the picture which usually results in a bit of a blurry picture.  And with the film being as expensive as it is, it is a bit frustrating to have blurry pictures.  Overall, though, I like the camera.  I'm happy that I made the purchase.", 'Great price!!

["Not sure if it works yet, because it's a Christmas gift, but looks intact.  There are a few more scratches on the back that I wasn't expecting.  The gift is for my daughter and she knows I shop Amazon.  If it was for anyone else, I would be concerned that it looked too used to give as a gift.", 'My 13 yo got this for her bday. She loves it.

Not one single complaint yet!', 'the pictures are pretty blurry.', "I'm so, so in love with my Mini 8. It was probably one of the best buys I've had on Amazon.

["This doesn't allow you as much freedom as the printer does, but I love it all the same. The quality of the pictures seem to come out better on the camera than they do on the printer, but maybe that's because these can't be filtered. The film is expensive, and the flash is SUPER bright, but I think I can manage. I love it!", 'Very compact and works great so far!!  The film is a little pricey, though.  Less room for mistakes...', 'Cute little camera but wish the films were bigger.', 'Daughter absolutely loves it.  Shipping time was awesome.', "My first Polaroid camera ever so I didn't know what to expect. It was super easy to use and super cute. The picture quality is not the best but I'm assuming is typical for a Polaroid. I do love having them instantly though. Absolutely love it.", 'Love it !', 'All instructions are in Chinese and does not come w the film and when we bought the film it does not work', 'Ruined Christmas.  The camera does not work.', "The box of this product says it includes film for 10 pictures. Ours did not. What a disappointment for our daughter who got this on Christmas Day and couldn't take any pictures. Very upsetting. Santa would have bought film had he known.", "This doesn't take pictures that you can actually make out!  Blurry and dark!!"]

It is so much fun to bring to the beach, on a hike, or on a trip to the city. It is durable, but not heavy or too clunky. The style is unique and minimal. Set up is quick, operation is entirely simple.This would make such a wonderful holiday or birthday present.', "Daughter wanted this and loves it.  the photo's are about wallet style - she loves that!", "Beautiful photos. This is the second mini we've bought hoping it was just a fluke. Broke after two photos. All the red lights flashed and wouldn't load.", 'Amazing!']
